                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, I have contributed to my highschool and college robotics teams, learned and applied various new coding concepts and languages in classes, and had an software engineering internship at General Dynamics Electric Boat, where I improved my coding skills and gained experience in the workforce. Throughout this time, my passion for coding has only increased as I realize how all the concepts intertwine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I would like to apply my skills in careers related to software development, embedded software development, CV, AI, or ML. Preferably I will have the chance to work with GUIs. I also have a particular interest in wearable technologies and the human-computer interactions that go with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently applying for internships, grad school programs (both Master's and Ph.D.), and jobs.

                    In my free time, I like to play badminton with friends in Connecticut, as well as travel to New York.
