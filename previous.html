                    <p>This is the current version. Doing this after learning more about js and the 'cascading' aspect of css through other websites. Completely changing UI to something that is (hopefully) cleaner.</p>

                    <p>This was the first time I did a project with html and js. I didn't know how to do anything but figured the final website looked pretty good.</p>
